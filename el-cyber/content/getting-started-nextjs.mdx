# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js 15 brings incredible improvements to the developer experience and application performance. In this guide, we'll explore the key features and how to get started.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework that provides:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** - Fast initial page loads
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** - Pre-rendered pages at build time
- **API Routes** - Build your backend alongside your frontend
- **File-based Routing** - Intuitive routing system

## Key Features in Next.js 15

### 1. App Router

The App Router is the new paradigm for building Next.js applications. It introduces:

- React Server Components by default
- Improved layouts and nested routing
- Built-in loading and error states
```typescript
// app/page.tsx
export default function HomePage() {
  return <h1>Welcome to Next.js 15!</h1>;
}
```

### 2. Server Actions

Server Actions allow you to run server-side code directly from your components:
```typescript
async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  'use server';
  
  const title = formData.get('title');
  // Save to database
}
```

### 3. Turbopack

Next.js 15 includes Turbopack, a new bundler written in Rust that's significantly faster than Webpack.

## Getting Started

Install Next.js with:
```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

That's it! You now have a working Next.js application.

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 is a powerful framework for building modern web applications. With its focus on performance and developer experience, it's an excellent choice for your next project.
