# 10 Tailwind CSS Tips for Better Productivity

Tailwind CSS has revolutionized how we write CSS. Here are 10 tips to make you even more productive.

## 1. Use @apply for Repeated Patterns

Instead of repeating utility classes, extract them:
```css
.btn-primary {
  @apply px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600;
}
```

## 2. Leverage Arbitrary Values

Need a specific value? Use square brackets:
```html
<div class="top-[117px] w-[347px]">
  Custom values!
</div>
```

## 3. Master the Container Class

The container class is your friend for responsive layouts:
```html
<div class="container mx-auto px-4">
  <!-- Centered, responsive content -->
</div>
```

## 4. Use Space and Divide Utilities

Stop manually adding margins between elements:
```html
<div class="space-y-4">
  <div>Item 1</div>
  <div>Item 2</div>
  <div>Item 3</div>
</div>
```

## 5. Dark Mode is Built-in

Add dark mode variants effortlessly:
```html
<div class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-black dark:text-white">
  Automatic dark mode!
</div>
```

## Conclusion

These tips will help you write cleaner, more maintainable Tailwind CSS. Happy coding!
